This section explores these primary benefits.\\n\\nEconomic Benefits\\nIT hardware, infrastructure, and related resources can be extremely expensive.

This type of purchase is a capital expenditure\\n(CapEx), which is money spent by an organization to acquire or maintain fixed assets. Most\\norganizations carefully budget their capital expenditures and require a yearlong budgeting\\nprocess to set the CapEx budget, and then hold strictly to the budget.\\nWith Azure, Microsoft handles the capital expenditures necessary to maintain and grow\\nthe service. An organization using Azure services therefore eliminates those capital expenditures and replaces them with operational expenditures (OpEx), which are monthly expenditures that the organization uses to run its operation. For example, rather than purchasing\\na license for Microsoft Office for each user (which would be a capital expense), the organization pays a monthly per-user fee for Microsoft 365 (an operational expense). Instead of\\nincurring a relatively large up-front cost for the perpetual license, the organization spreads\\nout the cost on a monthly basis.\\nThe move from a capital to an operational expenditure model can eliminate very large\\nup-front costs to deploy hardware, licenses, support contracts, and other resources.

However, Microsoft purchases servers in large\\nnumbers and therefore the cost is less per server and very likely much less than what you\\nwould pay for the same equipment.

Scalability is the\\nability to add computing resources to adjust to increased demand. For example, assume your\\norganization deploys a web farm to handle e-commerce business. For seven or eight months\\nout of the year, your needs are relatively stable.

Resources can be scaled automatically based on CPU usage, memory usage, storage\\nusage, and so on. Autoscale is the Azure service that enables you to configure automatic\\nscaling. You configure the parameters with Autoscale through rules that you create. When\\nthe thresholds defined in the rules are reached, Autoscale handles the process of scaling as\\ndefined in the rule.\\nSee https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/\\nplatform/autoscale-get-started for more information on configuring and using Autoscale.\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 62}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '73f75f9c87944645610422bc337ddc2e'}>,\n",

These servers together provide the SharePoint services that users consume. If the\\nweb server goes down, the service becomes unavailable.

None of those services could\\nfunction without storage, and Azure offers several core storage offerings. This section\\ndescribes these storage offerings.\\n\\nBlob Storage\\nAzure Blob storage is optimized to store very large amounts of unstructured data such as\\ntext and binary data. For example, if you need to store many documents of various types,\\nBlob storage is a great solution.

Examples include documents, as already discussed; video and audio files;\\nlarge amounts of data to be analyzed; and backup and recovery data.\\n\\nBlob Storage Tiers\\nHow you use storage and the type of storage you choose will determine how expensive that\\nstorage will be. You should take into account how you will access data to determine which\\nstorage solution is right for each situation. For example, you might access some data frequently and other data only seldom, if ever. In this scenario you should choose the least\\nexpensive option that meets your overall needs. At the opposite end of the spectrum, you\\nmight have data that is accessed frequently and therefore requires a different, more expensive storage option.\\nAzure Storage provides three access tiers for Blob storage to enable you to not only\\nfine-tune the type of storage you need but also minimize costs.

An example\\nis long-term storage for backups.\\n\\nHot and cool access tiers store data online, and the archive access tier stores data offline.\\nThe hot access tier has a lower access cost than the cool access tier but also has a slightly\\nhigher SLA and higher storage cost. Choosing the cool access tier means lower storage cost\\nbut higher access cost. This is generally a sound trade-off because you should access data\\nstored in the cool access tier less frequently. The archive access tier provides the lowest storage\\ncost of the three but has the highest cost to rehydrate the data from offline to storage.

Azure enables your organization to pay for only those services it uses, which enables you\\nto budget your IT infrastructure costs as an operational expenditure based on the services\\nyou consume in each month.

By contrast, purchasing hardware and software would require a\\ncapital expenditure, which is an acquisition of fixed assets.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nC. Microsoft acquires large amounts of hardware and other infrastructure resources to\\nsupport Azure, enabling it to purchase at a reduced cost, which represents an economy\\nof scale. In addition, distributing those resources among multiple customers also drives\\neconomy of scale and reduces the end cost to consumers of Azure.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nB.

In\\na public cloud, you do not have full control over all resources since many of the resources\\nare managed by the cloud provider.
